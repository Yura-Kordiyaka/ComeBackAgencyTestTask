unknown,"We are updating information on this website to reflect new NDIS legislation. Information on this page may change.
Self-management is when you manage your NDIS funding. It gives you the flexibility and choice to decide what supports you buy to pursue your plan goals.
It lets you think creatively about how you can use your funds to best meet your needs.
If you are interested in self-managing all or part of your NDIS plan, speak with your Local Area Coordinator (LAC) or NDIA planner. You could also talk to someone you know who is self-managing about their experience or connect with a self-management peer support group.
We are committed to improving the experience for self-managers.
We have developed the NDIS Guide to Self-management for people who are self-managing, or interested in self-managing their NDIS funding. The guide explains the benefits of self-management, roles and responsibilities and how to self-manage effectively.",

Self-management policy,"We have developed aself-management policy.The self-management policy explains how self-management works in the NDIS.
We developed this policy in consultation with NDIS participants, Independent Advisory Council members and representatives from the disability sector.
We also collectedinformation and researchfrom a variety of publications from all over the world and undertook a series of focus groups with NDIS participants.
Our staff and partners useOur Guideline – Creating your planto put this policy into action.
