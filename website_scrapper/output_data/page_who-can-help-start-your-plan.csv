Early childhood partners,"Families and carers of children younger than 9 who have an NDIS funded plan will work with an early childhood partner. Early childhood partners have experience working with children with disability or developmental delay. The NDIS early childhood approach is based on the principles of best practice in early childhood intervention to achieve better long-term outcomes for children.

Local area coordinator (LAC),"Most NDIS participants over 9 years of age will have an LAC to help them understand and use their plan. This includes showing participants how to use themyplace portaland connecting them with funded supports. LACs support participants throughout their plans to monitor how the plan is going, and they can check progress regularly.
Early childhood partners and LACs come from organisations in your local community, which work with the NDIA to deliver the NDIS.

Support coordinator,"If early childhood or LAC partners are not available in your area, or you need more help coordinating your supports and services, the NDIA may fund a support coordinator in your NDIS funded plan. A support coordinator will help you use your plan to work towards your goals, live more independently, increase your skills and be included in your community and in employment.
Specialist support coordination is a higher level of support coordination. It is an option for people whose situations are more complex and who need specialist help to coordinate their supports and services.
